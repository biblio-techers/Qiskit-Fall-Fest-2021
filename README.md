# Qiskit-Fall-Fest-2021
TEST
We are looking to create a Python class to construct popular base circuits for quantum computing, (such as the QFT and Teleportation algorithms). There is significant documentation on the Qiskit page detailing the background of these, (and more) circuits and how to build them for arbitrary numbers of qubits - see https://qiskit.org/textbook/ch-algorithms/quantum-fourier-transform.html#1.-Introduction-. However, our aims are to produce these circuits as a wrapped method, enabling users to add them as individual blocks to more complex circuits, or to attach them in full detail such that they can be subsequently modified, without having to write the logic from scratch each time. This project has the capacity to expand to other circuits following the time constraints.
